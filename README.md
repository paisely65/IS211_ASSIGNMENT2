# IS211_ASSIGNMENT2
Week 2 Assignment ­ Python Standard Library
For this week’s assignment, we will be going over the 5 modules that we reviewed in the Python Standard Library. This homework should be a bit more difficult than last week, but not too difficult. Starting next week, the lesson content and assignments will pick up the pace.
Overview
For this assignment, you will be reading data from a file located on the internet. The file is a listing of people’s name, their birthdays and an ID number in CSV format. This file, however, has some problems with it. Mostly, some of the birthdays are in an invalid format. The other columns in the CSV will be guaranteed to be in a proper format, so your code can assume so.
Using the modules that we learned about, you will design a program to do two things: write an output file recording which lines in the file c​annot​be processed correctly due to an improperly formatted date; and allow a user to enter in an ID number and print out that person’s information.
